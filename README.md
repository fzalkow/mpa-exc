Installation
=======================

To meet all the Python requirements, we recommend using Anaconda.

After installing Anaconda, create the virtual environment `mpa_exc`
by calling:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now, run `source activate mpa_exc` to start the environment  and
`jupyter-notebook` to start the notebook server.
