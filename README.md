Rebuild Matlab(R) pages
=======================

We use the `publish()` function in Matlab(R) to render the HTML output, e.g.

```
publish('exc_01_05.m')
```

Run Jupyter Notebooks
=====================

To run the Jupyter notebooks (formerly known as IPython Notebooks),
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed packages.

Then start a notebook instance by typing

```
jupyter notebook
```

and navigate to the path of this repository on your local machine.
